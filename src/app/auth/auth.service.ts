  // // private user: User;
  // // we want to store the currently authenticated user; private field because we want to access this only from inside the service
  // // now when we use the AngularFireAuth we no longer store user here, so our isAuth() method always returns false and we can't get to the training route like this
  // private isAuthenticated = false;
  // // isAuthenticated is of type boolean and should be initially false
  // // this authentication approach isn't ideal; we shoudn't store out authentication status in just a boolean, we should work with a token and we should also protect our server, our database, to see if we really got a working authentication
  // // to protect our database we should head to the Rules section in Database in our Firebase project(https://console.firebase.google.com/project/fitness-tracker-8958f/database/firestore/rules) and add 'allow read, write: if request.auth != null;' instead of just 'allow read, write;' to only allow authenticated users to read and write from our database
  // // we turned protection on Firestore so that unauthenticated users can't access our database and it works just like that, even though we haven't send any token to Firestore; it turns out that AngularFire automatically does that for us if we use AngularFire to manage authentication too; so just because we signed in with email and password meant that AngularFire behind the scenes also stored that token which we received, manages that token, and attaches it to outgoing request so we can work with the database just as we did before but the major difference is that is now protected, that unauthorized access is now not possible
