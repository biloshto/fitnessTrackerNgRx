  // here we're setting up lazy loading for the TrainingComponent, loadChildren is a keyword for lazy loading and here we pass a string because if we would pass a type and add an import we'd already include it in our bundle at this point so this has to be a string so that it can be analyzed at runtime (here we point to file, to the module we plan on importing when we reach that route, and in there we want to access the TrainingModule which we indicate by adding a hash-tag before the name of the class - this is required because our class name could differ from the file name)
  // canLoad work like the canActivate but it runs before the bundle is loaded
